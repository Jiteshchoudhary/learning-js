What is a Design Pattern?
A design pattern is like a reusable solution to a common problem in software design. Instead of figuring out how to solve a problem from scratch, you can apply these patterns to make your code easier to manage, extend, and understand.

Design patterns fall into three main categories:

Creational Patterns: Focus on how to create objects.
Structural Patterns: Focus on how objects are arranged and related.
Behavioral Patterns: Focus on how objects interact and communicate.

Design pattern in nodeJs.
1. Module Pattern (Used Heavily in Node.js)

The Module Pattern is essential for organizing your code and promoting reusability and encapsulation. In Node.js, every file is a module by default, and variables or methods inside a file are not exposed unless you export them explicitly.

In-Depth Explanation:
Encapsulation: The module pattern hides implementation details from the outside world. Only specific functionality is exposed.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across various parts of an application or across multiple applications.
Scalability: By breaking down your code into multiple modules, the application becomes easier to maintain and scale.

// mathOperations.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

module.exports = { add, subtract };

// app.js
const math = require('./mathOperations');
console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(math.subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3

Pros:
Separation of concerns: By isolating functionality, the code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.
Avoids global scope pollution: Variables within modules are private unless explicitly exported.
Lazy loading: Modules are loaded only when require() is called, optimizing memory usage.

Cons:
Circular dependencies: If two modules require each other, it can lead to issues.
Performance overhead: Constantly requiring modules may add slight performance overhead, but it’s minimal.
Use Cases:
Any application that grows large and complex should use the module pattern to organize functionality logically.

2. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In Node.js, the module system's caching behavior naturally implements this.

In-Depth Explanation:
Unique instance: Once the module is loaded for the first time, it is cached, and every subsequent require() call to the module returns the same instance.
Global Access Point: If you need a globally accessible shared resource (like a database connection, configuration object, or logging system), the Singleton pattern is perfect.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
// db.js
class Database {
  constructor() {
    if (!Database.instance) {
      this.connection = null;
      Database.instance = this;
    }
    return Database.instance;
  }

  connect() {
    if (!this.connection) {
      this.connection = 'Connected to DB';
    }
    return this.connection;
  }
}

module.exports = new Database();

// app.js
const db1 = require('./db');
const db2 = require('./db');

console.log(db1.connect()); // Connected to DB
console.log(db1 === db2);    // true - both instances are the same
Pros:
Controlled access: Ensures that only one instance of a resource-heavy object (like a database connection) is created.
Global state management: A shared object (e.g., configuration, services) is easily accessible across the entire application.
Cons:
Global state: A shared state can lead to side effects, and if not handled carefully, changes to the state can affect the entire application.
Testing complications: Testing Singleton patterns is tricky because the state persists between test cases unless manually reset.
Use Cases:
Managing database connections (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).
Application-wide logging service.
Global configuration objects.


3. Observer Pattern (Event-Driven Architecture)
The Observer Pattern is at the heart of Node.js’s event-driven architecture. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

In-Depth Explanation:
Loose coupling: The subjects (objects that emit events) and observers (objects that listen for events) are not tightly coupled. This makes it easy to extend or change behavior.
Async Notifications: Observers can respond to events emitted by the subject without the subject needing to know what the observers will do.
Example using Node.js EventEmitter:
javascript
Copy code
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class NotificationService extends EventEmitter {
  sendMessage(message) {
    console.log(`Sending message: ${message}`);
    this.emit('messageSent', message);
  }
}

const notificationService = new NotificationService();

notificationService.on('messageSent', (message) => {
  console.log(`Logger: Message sent: ${message}`);
});

notificationService.sendMessage('Hello, Observer Pattern!');
// Sending message: Hello, Observer Pattern!
// Logger: Message sent: Hello, Observer Pattern!
Pros:
Decoupled system: Subjects and observers don’t need to be aware of each other, enabling modularity.
Highly extensible: More observers can be added without changing the subject.
Asynchronous behavior: Useful for real-time systems, notifications, or event processing.
Cons:
Hard to debug: As more observers get added, it becomes harder to trace what is listening for which events.
Memory leaks: If observers are not removed properly, they can lead to memory leaks.
Use Cases:
Event-driven applications: When implementing notifications, logging systems, or real-time updates.
Asynchronous job queues: Emit events when a job is complete, and listeners react accordingly.


4. Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to change the type of object that will be created. It decouples the instantiation process from the business logic.

In-Depth Explanation:
Centralized Object Creation: All object creation logic is centralized, so modifications only need to be made in one place.
Polymorphism: Depending on conditions, different types of objects are created without changing the calling code.

class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.type = 'Car';
  }
  drive() {
    console.log('Driving a car');
  }
}

class Truck {
  constructor() {
    this.type = 'Truck';
  }
  drive() {
    console.log('Driving a truck');
  }
}

class VehicleFactory {
  static createVehicle(type) {
    switch (type) {
      case 'car':
        return new Car();
      case 'truck':
        return new Truck();
      default:
        throw new Error('Unknown vehicle type');
    }
  }
}

const myVehicle = VehicleFactory.createVehicle('car');
myVehicle.drive(); // Driving a car

Pros:
Separation of concerns: Object creation is separated from the business logic.
Flexible: Easy to extend by adding new object types without modifying existing code.
Cons:
Complexity: Introduces additional complexity, especially if not used correctly in simpler scenarios.



5. Proxy Pattern
The Proxy Pattern provides a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it. A proxy can perform actions like access control, logging, or lazy initialization.

In-Depth Explanation:
Interception: A proxy intercepts the calls to an object and can control what happens before or after interacting with the actual object.
Access Control: Useful for protecting objects that may require additional permissions or validation before being accessed.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const target = {
  message: 'Hello, World!',
};

const handler = {
  get: (target, prop, receiver) => {
    if (prop === 'message') {
      return `Intercepted: ${target[prop]}`;
    }
    return Reflect.get(...arguments);
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

console.log(proxy.message); // Intercepted: Hello, World!
Pros:
Access control: You can use proxies to add security checks, limit access, or implement rate-limiting.
Lazy initialization: Proxies can delay costly object creation until the object is needed.
Logging: Can be used to track operations on an object, making it useful for debugging or monitoring.
Cons:
Performance overhead: There’s some overhead introduced by intercepting operations, though this is typically minimal.
Complexity: Adds complexity by abstracting object interaction.
Use Cases:
Security: Proxy sensitive objects like database records to ensure validation.
Lazy loading: For delaying the loading of heavy resources, like images or data.
Rate limiting: Use a proxy to limit the number of times an object can be accessed within a time frame.
Design Patterns Used in Node.js by Default
Module Pattern: Node.js uses this pattern by default for modularizing code via the CommonJS module system (require(), module.exports).
Singleton Pattern: Since Node.js modules are cached after the first require() call, it ensures a single instance of the module is reused.
Observer Pattern: Node’s EventEmitter class uses the Observer pattern to emit and listen for events in an asynchronous, non-blocking way.
Key Takeaways for Sharing with Your Team Lead:
Module Pattern: Core to Node.js’s architecture, enables encapsulation and reusability.
Singleton Pattern: Leveraged automatically by Node’s module system; ideal for shared resources.
Observer Pattern: Central to Node’s event-driven, asynchronous design, useful for managing real-time systems.
Factory Pattern: Abstracts and centralizes object creation for flexibility and scalability.
Proxy Pattern: Provides control over object interactions, useful for access control and performance optimizations.
These patterns are foundational to building scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems, especially in Node.js where modularity and performance are key.
Over-engineering: In some cases, it may introduce unnecessary abstraction.
Use Cases:
When an application needs to create multiple types of objects but wants to keep the creation logic centralized.
When the specific class type required for instantiation is determined at runtime.
